### Complete Workflow Example

#### Option 1: Fully Automated Workflow (Recommended)
```bash
# Install the necessary packages globally
npm install -g ai-expert-workflow-mcp task-master-mcp

# Make sure to set your API keys in your environment or .env file:
# OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_key_here  (for AI Expert Workflow)
# ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_key_here    (for Task Master)

# Generate PRD and automatically parse it into tasks with one command
# You can specify a different model with the MODEL environment variable
MODEL=openai/gpt-4o npx ai-expert-workflow-generate "I want to build a recipe app that helps users find recipes based on ingredients they already have at home. Target users are home cooks who want to reduce food waste and save money."
```

This single command will:
1. Generate a comprehensive PRD document based on your description
2. Save it in a format compatible with Task Master
3. Automatically launch Task Master to parse the PRD and create tasks
4. Display the tasks and next steps

#### Option 2: Interactive Conversation Workflow

#### Step 1: Plan your Product with the AI Product Manager
```
User: Can you start the AI Expert Workflow for my new mobile recipe app?

AI: I'll start the AI Expert Workflow to help you plan your mobile recipe app. What specific aspect would you like to begin with?

User: Let's create a PRD with the AI Product Manager. I want to build a recipe app that helps users find recipes based on ingredients they already have at home.

AI: [Asks clarifying questions about target users, key features, monetization, etc.]

User: [Provides detailed responses about the app vision]
```

#### Step 2: Generate the PRD with Task Master Integration
```
User: Can you generate a complete PRD document based on our consultation and save it for Task Master?

AI: [Generates comprehensive PRD with MVP focus and lean startup validation plan]

AI: Document saved to PRD.md and also saved for Task Master at scripts/prd.txt. You can now use Task Master to parse this PRD with: "Can you parse the PRD at scripts/prd.txt and generate tasks?"
```

#### Step 3: Create Tasks with Task Master
```
User: Can you parse the PRD at scripts/prd.txt and generate tasks?

AI: [Task Master parses the PRD and creates a structured list of tasks with priorities]

User: What's the next task I should work on?

AI: [Task Master suggests the highest priority task with implementation details]
```

#### Step 4: Implement Tasks
```
User: Help me implement the "Ingredient Search Feature" task.

AI: [Task Master provides guidance and code for implementing the specific feature]
```

This streamlined workflow transforms your idea into a well-planned product and organized development tasks, all through natural conversation with specialized AI experts.

## Usage with Cursor AI

1. Add the MCP configuration to your editor:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ai-expert-workflow": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "ai-expert-workflow-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "OPENROUTER_API_KEY": "YOUR_OPENROUTER_API_KEY_HERE",
        "MODEL": "anthropic/claude-3-sonnet-20240229",
        "MAX_TOKENS": 8000,
        "TEMPERATURE": 0.7
      }
    },
    "taskmaster-ai": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "task-master-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY": "YOUR_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY_HERE",
        "MODEL": "claude-3-sonnet-20240229"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

2. Enable the MCP in your editor settings

3. Use natural language to interact with the AI Expert Workflow:

```
Can you start the AI Expert Workflow for my project?
Can you consult with the AI Product Manager to create a PRD for my project?
Can you generate a complete PRD document based on our consultation?
```

4. After generating your PRD, use Task Master to create tasks:

```
Can you parse the PRD at scripts/prd.txt and generate tasks?
```

## AI Expert Workflow

The workflow consists of three main phases:

### 1. Product Definition (AI Product Manager)

The Product Manager helps you create a PRD that includes:
- Product overview and problem statement
- User personas and user stories
- Feature requirements with priorities
- MVP scope definition
- Business model
- Lean startup validation plan

### 2. UX Design (AI UX Designer)

The UX Designer helps you create a UX document that includes:
- User personas and journey maps
- Information architecture
- Wireframe descriptions
- Prototype specifications
- User testing plans

### 3. Technical Architecture (AI Software Architect)

The Software Architect helps you create a specification that includes:
- System architecture
- Technology stack recommendations
- Functional specifications
- Technical design
- Integration requirements

## Task Master Integration

The AI Expert Workflow seamlessly integrates with Task Master in two ways:

> **Note:** You will need both API keys for the full workflow:
> - **OpenRouter API key** for AI Expert Workflow (get one from [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/keys))
> - **Anthropic API key** for Task Master (get one from [Anthropic](https://console.anthropic.com/))

### Method 1: Fully Automated Integration (Recommended)

Use the provided script to automate the entire process:

```bash
# Install both MCPs globally
npm install -g ai-expert-workflow-mcp task-master-mcp

# Make sure to set your API keys in your environment:
# export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_key_here  (for AI Expert Workflow)
# export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_key_here    (for Task Master)

# Run the automated script with your project details (default model)
npx ai-expert-workflow-generate "Your detailed project description"

# Or specify a different model for more creative or complex projects
MODEL=openai/gpt-4o npx ai-expert-workflow-generate "Your detailed project description"

# Or use a faster model for simpler projects
MODEL=anthropic/claude-3-haiku-20240307 npx ai-expert-workflow-generate "Your detailed project description"
```

This script:
1. Generates the PRD document based on your description
2. Automatically saves it in Task Master compatible format
3. Directly launches Task Master to parse the PRD and generate tasks
4. Handles different environments (CLI vs Cursor) appropriately

The process is completely automatic - you don't need to manually ask Task Master to parse the PRD. If you're using the script in Cursor, it will provide the exact command you should use next.

### Method 2: Manual Integration

For more control over the process:

1. When generating a PRD, use the `saveForTaskMaster` parameter:
   ```
   generateDocument productManager "Your project details" true
   ```

2. This saves your PRD in a format that Task Master can parse and creates Cursor workflow documentation

3. You can then use Task Master to create tasks:
   ```
   Can you parse the PRD at scripts/prd.txt and generate tasks?
   ```

4. Task Master will break down your PRD into actionable development tasks that you can track and implement
