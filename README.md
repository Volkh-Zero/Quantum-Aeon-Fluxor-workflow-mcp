### Complete Workflow Examples

#### Option 1: Standalone PRD Generation (Recommended)
```bash
# Install AI Expert Workflow globally
npm install -g ai-expert-workflow-mcp

# Set your OpenRouter API key
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_key_here

# Generate a PRD with one command
npx ai-expert-workflow-generate "I want to build a recipe app that helps users find recipes based on ingredients they already have at home. Target users are home cooks who want to reduce food waste and save money."
```

This single command will:
1. Generate a comprehensive PRD document based on your description
2. Save it as `prd.md` in your current directory
3. Also save it in Task Master compatible format (at `scripts/prd.txt`) in case you want to use Task Master later

#### Option 2: Interactive Conversation Workflow

#### Step 1: Plan your Product with the AI Product Manager
```
User: Can you start the AI Expert Workflow for my new mobile recipe app?

AI: I'll start the AI Expert Workflow to help you plan your mobile recipe app. What specific aspect would you like to begin with?

User: Let's create a PRD with the AI Product Manager. I want to build a recipe app that helps users find recipes based on ingredients they already have at home.

AI: [Asks clarifying questions about target users, key features, monetization, etc.]

User: [Provides detailed responses about the app vision]
```

#### Step 2: Generate the PRD
```
User: Can you generate a complete PRD document based on our consultation?

AI: [Generates comprehensive PRD with MVP focus and lean startup validation plan]

AI: Document saved to PRD.md. You can now review it and use it for your development planning.
```

#### Step 3 (Optional): Use Task Master to Create Tasks
If you want to break down your PRD into development tasks, you can optionally use Task Master:

```
User: Can you parse the PRD at scripts/prd.txt and generate tasks?

AI: [Task Master parses the PRD and creates a structured list of tasks with priorities]

User: What's the next task I should work on?

AI: [Task Master suggests the highest priority task with implementation details]
```

This streamlined workflow transforms your idea into a well-planned product with a comprehensive PRD. You can then optionally use Task Master to break it down into development tasks.

## Installation

### Global Installation (Recommended)

The easiest way to use AI Expert Workflow MCP is to install it directly from npm:

```bash
npm install -g ai-expert-workflow-mcp
```

This makes the `ai-expert-workflow-mcp` command globally available in your terminal.

### Local Development

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/bacoco/ai-expert-workflow-mcp.git
   cd ai-expert-workflow-mcp
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure environment variables:
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
   - Add your OpenRouter API key to the `.env` file (get one from https://openrouter.ai/keys)

4. Build the project:
   ```
   npm run build
   ```

5. Start the server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

6. Run tests (optional):
   ```
   # Run essential tests (recommended for quick verification)
   npm run test:essential

   # Run individual tests
   npm run test:mcp-only        # Test only the MCP server
   npm run test:openrouter-direct  # Test only the OpenRouter API

   # Run JavaScript tests
   npm test

   # Run TypeScript tests
   npm run test:ts

   # Or use the shell scripts
   ./tests/run-js-test.sh
   ./tests/run-ts-test.sh

   # Run comprehensive tests (builds and runs both JS and TS tests)
   ./tests/run-comprehensive-test.sh
   ```

   Test results will be saved to `tests/results/result_test.md` and `tests/results/result_test_ts.md`.


   > **IMPORTANT**: The tests will fail with the default API key. To verify your OpenRouter API key without modifying the `.env` file, use one of these scripts:
   >
   > Verify and update in one step:
   > ```
   > npm run verify-and-update YOUR_API_KEY
   > ```
   >
   > Or run the steps separately:
   > ```
   > # Verify your API key
   > npm run verify-openrouter YOUR_API_KEY
   >
   > # Update the MCP configuration
   > npm run update-config YOUR_API_KEY
   > ```
## Usage with Cursor AI

1. Add the MCP configuration to your editor:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ai-expert-workflow": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["dist/index.js"],
      "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}",

        "DEFAULT_SUBTASKS": 5,
        "DEFAULT_PRIORITY": "medium"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

2. Enable the MCP in your editor settings

3. Use natural language to interact with the AI Expert Workflow:

**Start the complete workflow:**
```
Can you start the AI Expert Workflow for my project?
```

**Work with specific experts:**
```
Can you consult with the AI Product Manager to create a PRD for my project?
```

**Move between stages:**
```
Let's move to the next stage
```

**Generate documents:**
```
Can you generate a complete PRD document based on our consultation?
```

**Check progress:**
```
What topics have we covered so far?
What topics do we still need to discuss?
```

4. After generating your PRD, optionally use Task Master to create tasks:

```
Can you parse the PRD at scripts/prd.txt and generate tasks?
```

## Enhanced AI Expert Workflow

The workflow has been enhanced with a structured conversation flow that guides users through a comprehensive product development process. It consists of three main phases, each with specific topics that must be covered:

### 1. Product Definition (AI Product Manager)

The Product Manager guides you through defining your product vision and requirements.

**Required Topics:**
- **Product Vision**: Overall concept and goals of the product
- **User Personas**: Detailed profiles of target users
- **Business Requirements**: Core requirements and constraints
- **Feature Map**: Key features with priorities
- **Success Criteria**: Metrics and KPIs for measuring success

**Output:** A comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD)

### 2. UX Design (AI UX Designer)

The UX Designer helps you create a user experience plan based on the PRD.

**Required Topics:**
- **UI Documentation**: Visual design and UI components
- **Feature Specifications**: Detailed feature descriptions
- **User Journeys**: User flows and paths
- **Interaction Patterns**: How users interact with features
- **Data Requirements**: Information architecture and data needs

**Output:** A detailed UX Design Document

### 3. Technical Architecture (AI Software Architect)

The Software Architect helps you define the technical implementation plan.

**Required Topics:**
- **Technical Architecture**: Overall system architecture
- **API Specifications**: API design and endpoints
- **Implementation Tasks**: Development tasks breakdown
- **Database Schema**: Data model and relationships
- **Testing Strategy**: Quality assurance approach

**Output:** A comprehensive Software Specification

The workflow automatically tracks which topics have been covered in each stage and guides you through a complete product development process. For more details, see [Enhanced Workflow Documentation](docs/enhanced-workflow.md).

## Standalone PRD Generation

The AI Expert Workflow is designed to work completely standalone:

```bash
# Install the AI Expert Workflow MCP
npm install -g ai-expert-workflow-mcp

# Set your OpenRouter API key
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_key_here

# Generate a PRD with the default model
npx ai-expert-workflow-generate "Your detailed project description"

# Or specify a different model for more creative or complex projects
MODEL=openai/gpt-4o npx ai-expert-workflow-generate "Your detailed project description"
```

This script:
1. Generates a comprehensive PRD document based on your description
2. Saves it as `prd.md` in your current directory
3. Also saves it in Task Master compatible format (at `scripts/prd.txt`) in case you want to use Task Master later

## Optional: Task Master Integration

> **Note:** Task Master integration is completely optional. You can use AI Expert Workflow on its own to generate PRDs.
>
> If you do want to use Task Master, you'll need these API keys:
> - **OpenRouter API key** for AI Expert Workflow (get one from [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/keys))
> - **Anthropic API key** for Task Master AI (get one from [Anthropic](https://console.anthropic.com/))
> - **Perplexity API key** (optional) for Task Master AI enhanced research capabilities (get one from [Perplexity](https://docs.perplexity.ai/docs/getting-started))

### Using Task Master to Parse the PRD

If you want to convert your PRD into development tasks, you can use Task Master in one of two ways:

**Option 1: MCP Integration** (For Cursor users)
1. Add the Task Master MCP to your editor configuration:
   ```json
   "mcpServers": {
     "taskmaster-ai": {
       "command": "npx",
       "args": ["-y", "task-master-ai"],
       "env": {
         "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY": "YOUR_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY_HERE",
         "MODEL": "claude-3-sonnet-20240229"
       }
     }
   }
   ```
2. Then ask your AI assistant:
   ```
   Can you parse the PRD at scripts/prd.txt and generate tasks?
   ```

**Option 2: Command Line Usage**
1. Install Task Master:
   ```
   npm install -g task-master-ai
   ```
2. Parse the PRD:
   ```
   task-master parse-prd scripts/prd.txt
   ```

### Utility Scripts

The project includes utility scripts to demonstrate Task Master integration:

- `generate-task-master-files.js`: Creates sample PRD and Task Master integration files using the MCP implementation
- `generate-task-master-files-simple.js`: Creates sample PRD and Task Master integration files without using MCP

These scripts are useful for testing and understanding how the integration works.
