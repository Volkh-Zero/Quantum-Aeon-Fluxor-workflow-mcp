## üöÄ Overview

The AI Expert Workflow MCP enhances your development process by introducing specialized AI expert roles that help define your project before implementation begins:

1. **Product Definition** with an AI Product Manager
2. **UX Design** with an AI UX Designer
3. **Technical Architecture** with an AI Software Architect

This structured approach helps prevent "spaghetti code" and maintains focus throughout development by creating clear documentation before task implementation begins.

- **Document Generation**: Create comprehensive professional documentation:
    - Product Requirements Document (PRD)
    - UX Design Document
    - Software Architecture Specification
- **Seamless Integration**: Works alongside Claude Task Master for a complete development workflow
- **Conversational Interface**: Engage with experts using natural language in your editor
