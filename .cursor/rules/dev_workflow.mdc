# Task Master Development Workflow

## Overview
- Task Master is an AI-driven development tool that helps organize and manage tasks
- It integrates with Claude and Cursor to provide a seamless development experience
- This workflow explains how to use Task Master effectively

## Commands
- Use `parse-prd` to generate tasks from a PRD
- Use `list` to see all tasks
- Use `next` to get the next task to work on
- Use `generate` to generate code for a specific task

## Integration with AI Expert Workflow
- AI Expert Workflow generates comprehensive PRDs
- These PRDs can be parsed by Task Master to create tasks
- The workflow creates a seamless planning-to-implementation pipeline

## Examples
To parse a PRD:
```
Can you parse the PRD at scripts/prd.txt and generate tasks?
```

```
