# AI Expert Workflow MCP - Project Analysis

## Project Overview

The AI Expert Workflow MCP is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides AI expert consultation services through Claude models. It allows users to consult with different AI expert personas (Product Manager, UX Designer, Software Architect) to create structured documents for product planning and development.

### Key Components

1. **MCP Server Implementation**:
   - `src/mcp.ts`: Defines the MCP server and registers tools
   - `src/index.ts`: Entry point that starts the server
   - `mcp-server.js`: JavaScript implementation for direct execution

2. **Expert Roles**:
   - `src/experts/`: Contains definitions for different expert roles
   - `src/experts/productManager.ts`: Product Manager expert
   - `src/experts/uxDesigner.ts`: UX Designer expert
   - `src/experts/softwareArchitect.ts`: Software Architect expert
   - `src/experts/index.ts`: Exports all expert roles

3. **Utilities**:
   - `src/utils/aiUtils.ts`: Functions for interacting with Anthropic API
   - `src/utils/fileUtils.ts`: Functions for file operations
   - `src/utils/promptUtils.ts`: Functions for prompt handling

4. **Type Definitions**:
   - `src/interfaces/expertInterfaces.ts`: Interfaces for expert roles
   - `src/types/config.ts`: Configuration interfaces
   - `src/types/mcp-sdk.d.ts`: Type declarations for MCP SDK

## Key Features

1. **Expert Consultation**:
   - Users can consult with AI experts in different roles
   - Each expert has specialized knowledge and prompts
   - Experts can answer questions and provide guidance

2. **Document Generation**:
   - Generate structured documents based on expert consultations
   - Documents follow templates for consistency
   - Support for different document types (PRD, UX Design, Software Spec)

3. **Task Master Integration**:
   - Integration with Claude Task Master
   - Save documents in a format compatible with Task Master
   - Convert PRDs into development tasks

## Technical Implementation

### MCP Server

The MCP server is implemented using the Model Context Protocol SDK. It registers tools that can be called by clients:

1. **consultExpert**: Consult with an AI expert in a specific role
2. **expertWorkflow**: Get an overview of the AI expert workflow
3. **generateDocument**: Generate a complete document with an AI expert

### AI Integration

The project uses the Anthropic API to interact with Claude models:

- Uses the `@anthropic-ai/sdk` package
- Configures the model, max tokens, and temperature
- Handles different content block types in responses

### Configuration

The project uses environment variables for configuration:

- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`: Required for making calls to Claude AI models
- `MODEL`: The Claude model to use (default: claude-3-sonnet-20240229)
- `MAX_TOKENS`: Maximum tokens for responses
- `TEMPERATURE`: Temperature setting for responses

## Code Quality

### Strengths

1. **Modular Design**:
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Expert roles are defined separately
   - Utility functions are organized by purpose

2. **Type Safety**:
   - TypeScript interfaces for expert roles
   - Type declarations for external dependencies
   - Proper error handling

3. **Configuration**:
   - Environment variables for configuration
   - Example configuration provided
   - Sensible defaults

### Areas for Improvement

1. **Documentation**:
   - More inline documentation would be helpful
   - Some functions could use more detailed JSDoc comments

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Error handling could be more comprehensive
   - More specific error types could be used

3. **Testing**:
   - No automated tests are included
   - Adding unit and integration tests would improve reliability

## Deployment and Usage

The project can be deployed in several ways:

1. **Local Development**:
   - Clone the repository
   - Install dependencies
   - Configure environment variables
   - Build and run the server

2. **Global Installation**:
   - Install globally via npm
   - Configure in editor settings
   - Use with Cursor AI or other MCP clients

3. **Integration with Task Master**:
   - Configure both MCPs in editor settings
   - Use AI Expert Workflow to create PRDs
   - Use Task Master to generate tasks from PRDs

## Conclusion

The AI Expert Workflow MCP is a well-structured project that provides valuable AI expert consultation services through the Model Context Protocol. It has a clean architecture, good separation of concerns, and integrates well with Claude models and Task Master.

The project successfully implements the MCP server without requiring an MCP API key, using only the Anthropic API key for AI functionality. The codebase is clean and organized, with only the necessary files remaining after the cleanup.

The main strengths of the project are its modular design, type safety, and flexible configuration. Areas for improvement include more comprehensive documentation, enhanced error handling, and the addition of automated tests.

Overall, the project provides a solid foundation for AI expert consultation and document generation, with good integration capabilities for development workflows.
