# Product Requirements Document

## Product Overview

The Recipe Finder app is a mobile and web application designed to help home cooks discover recipes based on the ingredients they already have at home. By allowing users to input available ingredients, the app suggests relevant recipes, enabling users to reduce food waste and save money by making the most of what they own.

## Problem Statement

Many home cooks face the challenge of having leftover or unused ingredients, which often leads to food waste and unnecessary grocery expenses. Existing recipe apps typically require users to shop for new ingredients, rather than making use of what is already available. There is a need for a solution that empowers users to efficiently utilize their pantry, fridge, and freezer contents to create delicious meals.
