# Product Requirements Document

## Product Overview

The Recipe Finder app is a mobile and web application designed to help home cooks discover recipes based on the ingredients they already have at home. By simply inputting available ingredients, users can receive personalized recipe suggestions, helping them reduce food waste, save money, and make meal planning easier.

## Problem Statement

Home cooks often struggle to decide what to cook, especially when they want to use up ingredients on hand to avoid waste and unnecessary grocery trips. Existing recipe apps typically require users to search by recipe or cuisine, rather than by available ingredients, leading to unused groceries and increased food waste. There is a need for a user-friendly solution that enables users to quickly find recipes that utilize what they already have at home.
