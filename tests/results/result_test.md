  - **UserIngredient:** user_id, ingredient_id, quantity
  - **Recipe:** id, name, ingredients (many-to-many), steps, nutrition, tags
  - **RecipeIngredient:** recipe_id, ingredient_id, quantity, unit

### 4. **Recipe Matching Logic**
- Find recipes where all required ingredients are available, or suggest recipes missing only a few items.
- Optimize queries:
  - Use JOINs (SQL) or Aggregations (NoSQL)
  - Optionally, use a search engine (Elasticsearch) for fuzzy matching and ranking.

### 5. **Admin/Content Management**
- For adding new recipes, editing ingredient lists, etc.

---

## Scalable Design Considerations

- **Authentication:** Use JWT tokens, OAuth providers.
- **Caching:** Use Redis/Memcached for popular recipe queries.
- **Async Tasks:** Use background jobs (Celery, BullMQ) for heavy work (e.g., recipe import).
- **Search:** For advanced ingredient matching, integrate Elasticsearch or similar.
- **Deployment:** Containerize with Docker, orchestrate with Kubernetes or use serverless platforms.
- **Monitoring:** Set up logging (ELK stack), metrics (Prometheus/Grafana).

---

## Sample User Flow

1. User logs in.
2. Adds ingredients (e.g., eggs, tomatoes, cheese).
3. App suggests recipes matching those ingredients.
4. User selects a recipe, views details, and optionally saves it.

Absolutely, I can help you create a comprehensive Product Strategy and Requirements Document. To get started, I‚Äôll need some context. Please answer the following questions:

1. What is your product or product idea?
2. Who is your target customer?
3. What problem does your product solve?
4. Who are your main competitors?
5. What is your business goal (e.g., revenue, user growth, engagement)?
6. What platforms will your product be available on (e.g., web, mobile)?
7. Do you have a timeline or key milestones in mind?
8. Are there any technical, legal, or market constraints?

Once you provide this information, I‚Äôll generate a tailored product strategy and requirements document for you.
