Since I'm processing and understanding the request, that's a good sign. \n\nNext, I should check if I'm using the specified model, deepseek-r1t-chimera. I know I'm an instance of the deepseek model, but I'm not entirely sure about the exact version. However, the user seems to be testing the integration, so it's safe to assume that if I'm responding, the API is functioning as intended.\n\nI should respond with the exact phrase they provided to confirm everything is working. No need for extra information unless they ask for it. \n\nLet me make sure the response is precise and matches their request exactly. \n\nOkay, time to send the confirmation back to them.\n"
